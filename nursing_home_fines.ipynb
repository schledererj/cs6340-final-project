    "# Predicting Nursing Home Fines\n",
    "\n",
    "[Direct Supply's](https://www.directsupply.com/) business is focused on senior living and healthcare. We have services in procurement, building management, design and construction, and health and wellness. The ability to predict fines a nursing home might receive would have several benefits to both the nursing home and to Direct Supply. Direct Supply may be able to help the nursing home avoid fines through the products and services that we offer. We can focus sales and engagement efforts around the things we know they need. From Direct Supply's perspective, we may be able to anticipate a downturn in sales, better estimate credit worthiness, or get ahead of potential merger and acquisition activity."
